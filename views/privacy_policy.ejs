    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h3>Disclaimer &amp; Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This CareTracker app is NOT SECURE IN ANY WAY, and is not intended for use with real medical information... yet. It is intended only for testing purposes and any real health information that is uploaded IS NOT SAFE AND SECURE.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, our lawyers have also come up with a very complicated legal document that they would like us to list here to protect ourselves while we work on something more appropriate. So by testing our app, you are also subjecting yourselves to the privacy policy described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      To try to help explain this policy, we have come up with our own summary version (although the one you are legally bound to is the official one that you will find below this summary version).
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
      We will do our very best to protect your data and our technology team is top notch and understands security and privacy better than most. But if you do something inherintly unsecure (like give someone your password or choose a simple password) your data may end up in the wrong hands. Be sensible. When we do eventually launch a real product, your data will be in good hands. </br></br>
    </li>
    <li>
      We will never intentionally give another organization (such as an insurance company) your personal health information unless you (or someone who has authorized access to your data) specifically requst for us to do so. However, we may use your data in a de-identified way to learn more about population health, sell in its aggregate form, or do some analytics or analysis that we believe will add value somewhere along the value chain. Rest assured we will not (intentionally) breach your privacy. </br></br>
    </li>
    <li>
      We might send you emails and try to market other products to you... and we may even try to make money of the data we collect of you. We will eventually try to build a real business and may find something interesting that someone wants to pay for. Rest assured, your privacy will not be breached unless you approve. However, we will eventually need to make some money and we may do that by using your information in its aggregate form or by specifically targeting things towards you.</br></br>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Official Hint Health Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Hint Health, Inc. and any subsidiaries and affiliated entities (together, “Company”, “we” or “us”) with respect to the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal and other information received or generated by Company when you use or interact with the games, applications, services, products and websites (collectively, the “Services”) offered or made available by Company, including but not limited to its personal care tracking application and similar personal healthcare applications (together with any modifications, updates or versions thereof, the “Apps”).  By downloading, using or accessing the Apps or other Services, or by submitting information to Company, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h4>Security and Protection of Your Information</h4>
    <p>
      Company is very concerned with safeguarding your information and protecting the security of your Personal Information.  We use appropriate, industry-typical security measures and technology to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, user information covered by this Privacy Policy (excluding any such data that may be disclosed or publicly shared in accordance with this Privacy Policy).  In this regard, we employ administrative, physical and electronic measures (including certain encryption technologies) designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure and to safeguard your information against loss, theft, alteration and destruction.  No method of security is 100% secure.  In addition, some of your information may be protected by passwords selected and maintained by you.  Accordingly, the security of such information will depend upon the strength of your selected password and you ability to keep such password secured and confidential.
    </P>
    <p>
      We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable statutes on security breach notification) to your email (if we have it) or via conspicuous posting on or through the Services in an expedient manner and without unreasonable delay, insofar as these are consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

    <h4>Changing or Deleting Your Information; Storage and Retention</h4>
    <p>

If in the future, the Company may implement a system to allow for a complete review and deletion of all you information, but Company has no obligation to provide or create such a mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like us to delete your Personal Information in our system, please contact us and we will consider making good faith efforts to accommodate your request, though we have no obligation to do so (and will not do so if we have any legal obligation to retain the record or legitimate business need to retain such information). See below for privacy contact information.  In such cases, we ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests because of the reasons stated above or because such requests are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, relate to information that is incorporated into other databases or Services as permitted by this Privacy Policy, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes or derivative information that is not separable), or for other reasons. Because of the way we maintain certain Services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.  We are not responsible for updating, correcting or removing any of your information disclosed to or held by third parties.
